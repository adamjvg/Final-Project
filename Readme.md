1. Set up twitter api key
2. find https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/bot-repository/datasets/twibot-20/twibot20.json
3. Scrap this and try a different angle
4. Find another dataset that list's whether an account is 'spammer' or 'non-spammer' at http://nsclab.org/nsclab/resources/
5. Use TensorFlow to build a deep learning model that can predict whether the user is spam or not.
6. Tune TensorFlow to try and achieve an accuracy rate higher than the known number of spammers to non-spammers.
7. Add layers to increase accuracy by decreasing the number of nodes by half per layer.
8. we then saved the model so we could use it in tensorflow.js
9. write a js script that allows then user to enter parameters with which they can use to test out whether the thing thinks its a spammer
10. all the results are displayed in html 
11. heroku it up
