1. Set up twitter api key
2. find https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/bot-repository/datasets/twibot-20/twibot20.json
3. Scrap this and try a different angle
4. Find another dataset that list's whether an account is 'spammer' or 'non-spammer' at http://nsclab.org/nsclab/resources/
5. Use TensorFlow to build a deep learning model that can predict whether the user is spam or not.
6. Tune TensorFlow to try and achieve an accuracy rate higher than the known number of spammers to non-spammers.
7. Add layers to increase accuracy by decreasing the number of nodes by half per layer.
